_I created three case studies created for Emerson Bearings and we turned them into a single-page with strong CTAs designed to get people to "Speak to an expert." The page was created in 2017 and is still live and generating leads._

Emerson Bearing is committed to providing all of our customers with the right support and parts they need. When bearings fail to work properly, all related processes have to shut down. That means we take pride in quick service, custom parts development, and engineering assistance to improve machinery life with a simple bearing change.

We keep our customers happy by delivering all that we promise and more when they need us the most. Here are just three stories that exemplify our Service, Inventory, and Solutions.
