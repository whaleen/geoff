Created this case study for Federal Heath's first-ever brand conversion of a Pemex station to British Petroleum (BP). Federal Heath design and production teams produced the majority of the components for the rebrand, including canopy fascia and dispenser graphics.

Its specialty contracting group spearheaded the installation and served as the coordination leader of additional BP contract suppliers.
