I spoke with Brian Cohen (President, CEO and a member of the Board of Directors of Pacific Specialty Insurance Company and its sister companies Western Service Contract Corporation, and The McGraw Company) and Mick Noland (Vice President and Chief Underwriting Officer for MetLifeâ€™s Property & Casualty Business) to create an executive look at how insurers are turning to analytics and why this matters to the C-Suite.
