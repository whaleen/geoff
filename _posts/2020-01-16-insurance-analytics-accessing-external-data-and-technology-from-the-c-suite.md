I interviewed with Brian Cohen, President and CEO of Pacific Specialty Insurance Company and The McGraw Company, and Mick Noland, Vice President and Chief Underwriting Officer for MetLifeâ€™s Property & Casualty Business.

We created an executive-focused look at how insurers are turning to analytics and why this matters to the C-Suite's roadmap for future efforts.

It served as a starting point for Data Driven Business to speak to customers about the wealth of data insurers have and can safely use, especially with cloud-based analytics platforms.
