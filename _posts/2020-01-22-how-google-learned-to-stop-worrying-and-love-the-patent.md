This report looks at the patent wars that were raging in 2011 and called out Google's big shift from the champion of the little guy to a patent hawk in its own right.

On a personal note, this is one of my favorite reports from my time at Rider Research and the publication _The Online Reporter_. 

It represents one of the first projects I was able to tackle on my own and lead in design and development. Charles Hall, the owner of Rider Research, was a great mentor and friend. 

We never know the breaks and opportunities that will change the course of our lives until well after they happen. This was one of the biggest.
