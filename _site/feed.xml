They use storytelling to keep their audience engaged and coming back for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our cultural love of “Mad Men” has shown us that the ability to create a compelling story allows any brand to sell a product, but storytelling’s power doesn’t stop there. It works just as well within your organization to push for any new idea. Spinning an engaging story allows you to turn a bland fact or piece of information into an idea, and then guide your audience to a desired conclusion. Your fact is now their truth and it’s not just limited to a sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storytelling even can be more persuasive than purely logical arguments, according to studies like &lt;a href=&quot;this one from Ohio State University&quot;&gt;this one from Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt;. This is true even in data-centric industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my work with major analytics companies and divisions, storytelling has even emerged as a key differentiator that helps a candidate get hired. These branches need a storyteller who can weave complex information into a narrative that quickly presents insights to executive leadership. A good storyteller translates into better financial support, which in turn can yield more insightful business intelligence and a stronger return on investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news for everyone is that telling an engaging story gets easy when you put the right pieces into place. Whether you’re deep in data or want a blog that gets customers to make a purchase, here are three important considerations that can turn your tales into gold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;start-with-your-lesson&quot;&gt;Start With Your Lesson&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you begin crafting a story, decide what you want someone to understand and believe at the end. Keep your audience in mind and make your lesson important to the audience by framing it in something they desire. For businesses, this often is positioning a product or service as a best solution to a problem to make the customer’s day better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;find-a-conflict&quot;&gt;Find a Conflict&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories that survive the test of time tend to present a great conflict with someone the reader can root for –someone the audience identifies with and feels interchangeable with. Understandable Conflicts or challenges makes your story compelling. Improve your business storytelling by establishing a clear line from the problem to its solution via your takeaway. Mix in a few finer details to keep your story from feeling too much like a pitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;limit-your-background-explanation&quot;&gt;Limit Your Background Explanation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help your story engage with a wider audience by making the “why” behind the problem broad. It’s important to explain the root cause, but be careful of description that can limit your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, let’s assume you’re selling a product that can be used anytime of the year. Making a “2015 Spring Cleaning” blog post gives you an easy theme to work with to tout your benefits. Unfortunately, the post’s perceived usefulness can end once summer arrives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply removing references to 2015 can extend your content’s usefulness to the following spring. That’s an extra year (at least) just by removing the date from your headline. To extend it even further, you can broaden the theme to general cleaning to expand it from a 3-month window to any time of the year. If you like the Spring Cleaning theme, use it in your social media promotions. It harnesses the immediacy of social networks, but gives the heart of your story an evergreen approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining these three simple lessons can give you a better story and help you achieve goals from improved traffic and conversions to convincing your boss to fund your project, department, or ambition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-lagniappe-lesson&quot;&gt;THE LAGNIAPPE LESSON&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skip any part you find boring. Whether you’re presenting to a crowd, writing on a blog or tweeting out to the world, slow parts ruin stories. Cherry-pick your facts and descriptions to create quick, engaging content. It gets your audience to your takeaway faster and they’ll enjoy the experience that much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the boom in offerings hasn’t always come with an equally large outpouring of explanations about the differences in AI, machine learning, process automation, and much more. Two big camps are fighting for business investment right now — AI and RPA — so I thought it might be good to share a little bit about what sets the two apart and how you can make a quick determination about what your business needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that discovering the difference will make it easier to set expectations and budgets when you go for the all-important executive buy-in for your next project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet. Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture.

To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education must also train one for quick, &lt;strong&gt;resolute and effective thinking&lt;/strong&gt;. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoff</name></author><summary type="html">Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths.
